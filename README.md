# Startups Assessment using Machine Learning

![World Finance Review](https://github.com/Sagar401/Startup_Assessment_using_ML/blob/master/startups_world_finance_review.jpg)

A startup company grows and grows until it proven itself – we had a prolific engagement with RedCrow (crowdfunding platform) company during our final semester capstone project work. RedCrow connects financial and human capital to healthcare start-ups. Despite of the fact that there are several prominent reasons for a startup to fail, “funding” still stands as foremost as this is the backbone of any unit to operate. There have been several studies in past in order to forecast the growth and success of startups. This project offers a web-based comprehensive decision-making tool to cater two broader spaces:

**Predict the final position of startup (operational or close):** able to support startups, investors and investment platforms like RedCrow to predict the unicorn’s prospects.

* Analytical Approach:
  * Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/mauriciocap/crunchbase2013
  * Key Features: Average Funding, Total Funding, Delta between First and Last funding, No of Investors, Funding Rounds, Market Category etc.
  * Outcome: Startups Stage as Operational Or Close

**Stage evolution : startups movement from Seed to Stage A:** 
  * Support hypothesis of association between funding stage with digital & social presence
  * Probability of startups to establish Seed and Series A funding position

**Social Media presence for Stage Evolution** -  Twitter Follower Impact on Crowdfunding

* Analytical Approach:
  * Data Source: Web Scraped from Angelist.co/companies (for startup info) and Twitter(for startups social presence)
  * Key Features: Total Funding, Annual Funding, Size, Market Category and Twitter Followers etc.
  * Outcome: Raised 2m (0- No, 1- Yes) for Seed Stage and Raised 12m( 0- No, 1- Yes) for Series A

**CRISP-DM Methodology:** - for improvised outcome

**Scope to explore:** - study and analyse the impact of other social media key indicators (Engagement rate, No of @Mentions, Click ratio, post score, sentiment score etc…) on startup's funding stage evolution and final position as Operational or Close
